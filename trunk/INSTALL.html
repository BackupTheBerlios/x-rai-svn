<h1>Pre-requisite</h1>

<p>In order to install x-rai, you need: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A web server (apache)</li>
  <li>PHP with PEAR, modules: postgresql, xslt</li>
  <li>a postgresql server</li>
  <li>perl, bash </li>
</ul>

<h1>Installing</h1>

<p>Decompress the archive or checkout via SVN. The web directory is the only
one that have to be published by the web server, through a link for example
with UNIX. The file structure must not be changed.</p>

<p>Change the name of "settings-template.inc" to "settings.inc" in
web/include, and edit that file with the corresponding values. </p>

<h2>The .xrai files</h2>

<p>The .xrai files are used to describe the structure of a collection. The
main document (the root of the structure) is the file index.xrai within the
root directory of the x-rai file of the collection. They are used for
allowing the user to browse into the collection. They are basically HTML
elements with two special elements, namely <strong>subcollection</strong> and
<strong>document</strong>. </p>

<p>&lt;subcollection path=""&gt;...&lt;/subcollection&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;document path=""&gt;...&lt;/document&gt;</p>

<p>A path must be a path to the corresponding x-rai in the case of
"subcollection" or to an XML file of the collection in the case of
"document".</p>

<p>The interface will create each time a link using as title text the text
inside "subcollection" or "document".</p>
